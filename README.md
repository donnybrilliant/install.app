# install.app

A GUI for install.sh[https://github.com/donnybrilliant/install.sh]

## Thoughts
- sudo working with python3, but not compiled .app
- Refactor whole process
- "Try again" when password is wrong, doesnt work when right..
- Add more secure password process
- Fix scroll and ugly UI
- Add screens for configuration, nvm, appstore and all from install.sh
- Preselected homebrew packages (javascript, python etc)
- Build in swift instead?
